# JRT OS

This is a project for understanding how an operating system works. The idea is to create all the components used on daily work, for example:
- File systems
- Programming languages (such as C, Python and Rust)
- Terminal
- Network interfaces
- Device drivers
- Browser

The **only** goal of this project is understing how an operating system works, **DO NOT** use any of this code on production environments, as it is very likely vulnerable code.
